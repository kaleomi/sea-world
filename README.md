# Tidewater

An island fishing game for the browser. Cast from the pier, the beach or your own boat, fight the fish,
sell your catch to Joe at the fish stand, and spend it on better gear at Marta's chandlery. Around it is a
real-time tropical island and ocean: swim the reef, drive the boat out to deep water, and watch a humpback
breach. It runs directly on WebGPU and WGSL with its own small rendering engine, no framework.

## Requirements

- A browser with WebGPU: a recent Chrome, Edge or Safari.
- A capable GPU. It targets 60 fps at 2560×1267 on an Apple M5 Pro, and dynamic resolution scales
  the render down on slower machines.
- The first load compiles several hundred shaders, which can take a minute or more. Later visits are
  faster because the browser caches them.

## Features

**Fishing**
- A spinning rod and reel that cast, reel and bend under load, with the bail, rotor and crank animated.
- Bites that depend on the water (shallows, pier, reef, bay, deep water), depth and time of day, across
  18 Caribbean species.
- A line-tension fight: keep the tension in the green band, ease off when the fish runs.
- A full-screen catch card with the fish's length and weight, a fish log with records, and a cooler.
- Joe's orders: bring him a number of one species above a set weight for more than the stand pays.
  Filling orders earns reputation, which unlocks reef, deep-water and trophy orders and a better price
  for everything you sell.
- The fish log is a collection: a bronze, silver or gold medal per species by the biggest one landed,
  hints on where and when to find the ones you haven't caught, and cash bonuses for 5, 10, 15 and all
  18 species and for 3, 9 and 18 gold medals.
- Five legendary fish, named giants that only feed in their own conditions (rain on the reef, a high
  tide at night under the pier, first light over deep water off Ember Island, Coral Atoll's reef after
  dark, a thunderstorm).
  They are rare bites that need upgraded line, pay a bounty and go on the fish log's trophy wall.
- Fishing tournaments at Joe's stand: pay the fee, then five minutes against three local rivals for
  the heaviest fish, the heaviest bag or the heaviest of one species. The top three share the purse;
  a win moves you up from the Harbour Cup to the Island Derby and the Tidewater Open.
- Joe's fish stand buys your catch; Marta's chandlery sells line, reels, rods, a bigger hold, fuel, a rebuilt
  engine, a fish finder and deck floodlights for night fishing.
- Walk the deck and the wheelhouse while the boat drifts; the boat burns fuel. Step off away from the
  dock (onto another island's beach, or for a swim) and the anchor goes down where it reaches bottom.
- A first-play guide, contextual tips and a minimap. Progress is saved in the browser.

**Ocean**
- Four-cascade FFT ocean (Tessendorf spectra) with foam, whitecaps, wind streaks and swell.
- Depth-aware breaking waves with peeling shoulders, whitewater, spray and foam lace.
- A shallow-water simulation for swash running up and down the sand.
- Boat wake and bow spray, and a whale wake.
- Caustics on the seabed and in the water, with light shafts.
- A split underwater/above-water view at the waterline, with water droplets on the lens after surfacing.
- Refraction of the seabed through the surface, including behind the pier and boats.

**Sky**
- Physically based atmosphere (Hillaire 2020) with a sun, moon and stars.
- Volumetric cumulus and wispy cirrus with cloud shadows on the land.
- Aerial perspective and sea haze.
- God rays, and a lens flare with occlusion.

**World**
- An island with a beach, hills, headlands and rocks.
- More islands out in the same sea, reached by boat with no loading: Coral Atoll (a ring of reef and
  sandy islets round a lagoon, south-east) and Ember Island (a volcano with a crater and a beach ring,
  west), with their own palm groves, forest and scrub. Each is plain data in `src/world/islands/`
  generated from a terrain recipe, with its own fish
  and legends; tuna and mahi roam the open sea between them. The minimap shows the way and the distance.
- A fishing village, a pier, and the vendors' stalls built from Poly Haven scans.
- Realistic vendor characters (Microsoft Rocketbox) with skinned animation.
- A coral reef with fish.
- Palms, bananas, monstera, elephant ear, heliconia, bird of paradise, broadleaf trees, shrubs and dune
  grass, with impostors and dithered LOD fades.
- Beach debris.
- Birds, crabs and marine snow.
- A humpback whale with an escort of fish, blows, fluke dives and breaches.

**Lighting and post**
- Cascaded shadows with contact-hardening penumbrae, and screen-space contact shadows.
- Ground bounce light.
- GTAO ambient occlusion.
- Temporal upscaling and sharpening.
- Bloom, auto exposure and motion blur.
- Night lighting from lanterns, windows and the boat, plus a flashlight that also works underwater.

**Audio**
- Positional audio from real CC0 field recordings: surf timed to each breaking wave, wind, birds, the boat
  engine, footsteps by surface, underwater ambience, whale song, and the rod and reel (casts, the bail,
  reeling, the drag, line snaps, splashes).

### Fishing

Walk the deck of the boat while it drifts, or fish from the pier and the beach. Cast, wait for the bobber
to dip and strike when it's pulled under, then play the fish: keep the line tension in the green band,
ease off when it runs. Different water holds different fish (the shallows, the pier, the reef, the bay and
deep water offshore), and some bite best at dawn, dusk or night. Sell your catch to Joe at the fish stand
on the beach by the pier, and spend it at Marta's chandlery by the boathouse: stronger line, a faster reel,
a longer rod, a bigger fish hold, a larger fuel tank, a rebuilt engine, a fish finder and deck floodlights for
night fishing. The boat burns diesel at the helm; fill up at the chandlery. Progress is saved in the browser.

The settings panel (H) exposes the sea state, time of day, sun azimuth, clouds, haze, post-processing and
more.

## URL options

Add these to the URL, for example `?fly&noAudio`:

| Option | Effect |
|---|---|
| `fly` | Start in the free camera |
| `noAudio` | Disable sound |
| `noClouds` | Skip the volumetric clouds |
| `noHaze` | Skip the haze and sun shafts |
| `noCaustics` | Skip caustics |
| `noVeg` | Skip vegetation |
| `noSim` | Skip the swash (shallow-water) simulation |
| `noCache` | Regenerate the terrain instead of reading it from the browser cache |
| `server=ws://host:5191` | Join that shared sea on load (see Multiplayer) |
| `noNet` | Leave multiplayer out |

## Running locally

```sh
npm install
npm run dev      # http://127.0.0.1:5189
npm run build    # static build in dist/
```

Every push to `main` deploys to GitHub Pages through `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

## Multiplayer (shared sea)

Several players can sail the same sea: you see the others' boats and figures with their names over
them and dots on the minimap, and hear when they land a big fish or a legend. Each game still keeps
its own save, money and fish; the server only relays where everyone is and what they catch.

```sh
npm run server   # installs the server's one dependency (ws) the first time, then listens on 127.0.0.1:5191
```

In the game open the cooler (I), press **Online**, pick a name and colour and **Connect**. Two
browser tabs on the same computer are enough to try it.

Other machines need more than the address: browsers only run WebGPU on `localhost` or on an
`https://` page, and an https page may only open a secure `wss://` socket. So to play with friends
elsewhere, the game and the server go behind https on a public host (the server takes `HOST` and
`PORT` from the environment, e.g. `HOST=0.0.0.0` behind a TLS proxy). `GET /` on the server answers
`{ ok, players }` for health checks.

`render.yaml` describes the server as a [Render](https://render.com) web service (Render serves it
over `wss://` on its own https address). Once it runs, put that address in `.env.production` as
`VITE_NET_SERVER=wss://<your-service>.onrender.com` so the published game offers it by default.
